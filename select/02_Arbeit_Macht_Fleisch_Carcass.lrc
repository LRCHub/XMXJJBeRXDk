[00:27.55] Prognathous gears grind
[00:29.59] So diligent and
[00:30.68] Serrated they mesh
[00:31.63] Toothed cogs churn
[00:32.96] So trechant
[00:34.00] Against soft flesh
[00:35.37] Worked to the bone
[00:36.88] Up to the hilt
[00:37.71] Depredated
[00:38.97] Raw materialism
[00:40.00] To stoke the furnaces
[00:42.15] Toiling, rotting
[00:45.54] Life slowly slips away
[00:48.95] Consumed, inhumed
[00:56.07] In this mechanized
[00:57.07] Corruption line
[01:05.34] By mincing machinery
[01:06.37] Industrialised
[01:09.77] Pulped and pulverised
[01:15.08] Enslaved to the grind
[01:25.58] 
[01:24.83] Blood, sweat, soil, tears
[01:27.83] Arbeit macht frei/fleisch
[01:40.33] 
[01:52.38] Grave to the grind
[02:01.38] 
[02:17.36] Inimitable gears twist
[02:18.93] To churn a living grave
[02:21.07] Stainless cogs shredding
[02:22.82] Scathing pistons
[02:23.76] Bludgeon and flail
[02:24.91] Stripping to the bone
[02:26.77] Retund mandrels levigate
[02:28.23] Just raw material
[02:30.17] Your pound of flesh
[02:30.76] For the suzerain
[02:32.51] Toiling, rotting
[02:35.69] Life slowly dissipates
[02:39.43] Consumed, inhumed
[02:45.62] In a corruption line
[02:47.07] Mechanized
[02:54.82] By mincing machinery
[02:55.83] Industrialized
[02:59.74] Crunched and brutalised
[03:04.63] A grave to the blind
